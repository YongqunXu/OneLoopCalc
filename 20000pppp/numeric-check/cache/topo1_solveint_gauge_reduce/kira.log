4 Fermat/Blackbox instances will be run in parallel.
The user defined environment variable FERMATPATH for Fermat is set:
/home/yqx/Program/fermat6/ferl6/fer64
One variable is set to 1: {}
The directories for the temporary files, result files and the sector mapping files are: 
./tmp
./results
./sectormappings
